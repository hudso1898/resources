# Exploration #4: Industry Preparation 

*Due Tuesday, December 10 at 11:59:00pm*

*Submit through GitHub Classroom **AND** Canvas*

[https://classroom.github.com/a/PqAbraqR](https://classroom.github.com/a/PqAbraqR)

For this exploration, I want you to pick a topic that real-world employers are asking for and then go and learn it so you can get a job and start your career. 

Go to a job-listing website like [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/index.htm) and search for web-related jobs. You could search for "web developer", "web designer", "full stack developer", "software engineer", "Node.js developer", or something of the sort. Read a few job descriptions and look for technologies that you would want to explore. Use those topics as the focus for this exploration. The location of the job does not have to be in Columbia, it can be anywhere that you wish.

For example, I went to [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/index.htm) in class and searched for "[full stack developer](https://www.glassdoor.com/Job/columbia-full-stack-developer-jobs-SRCH_IL.0,8_IC1130886_KO9,29.htm)" (That is a link to search for all the full stack developers in Columbia, although you can search outside of Columbia as well). I found a listing for CARFAX here: [https://www.glassdoor.com/job-listing/fullstack-developer-carfax-JV_IC1130886_KO0,19_KE20,26.htm?jl=3230981116&ctt=1575170216457](https://www.glassdoor.com/job-listing/fullstack-developer-carfax-JV_IC1130886_KO0,19_KE20,26.htm?jl=3230981116&ctt=1575170216457)

It looks like CARFAX wants developers who are passionate about:

-   Java 8 and Groovy
-   MVC Architecture
-   HTML5/CSS3/Javascript/Bootstrap, web standards, libraries/frameworks like jQuery and React
-   RESTful/Service Oriented Architectures
-   Spring/Grails
-   MySQL/Oracle/RabbitMQ
-   Continuous Integration & Test Driven Development

Well, MVC, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Bootstrap, jQuery, RESTful, MySQL, Oracle, and Test Driven Development are topics we've used in class! They also mention Spring and Grails. Those are two frameworks we haven't talked about. They might be good options to explore. They also mentioned Groovy which is an object oriented programming language for the Java platform, which could be explored, as well as RabbitMQ.

So you should search for a web development job you would like, find the topics that were not covered in this class, and research them for this exploration. You should also find topics that you have not researched in the past. For example, we did not look into React, however many students looked into React for their previous explorations, so you should focus on something new for this exploration.

You are to create a post on the Exploration 4 discussion board with the following **(30 points)**:

-   a link to the job posting where you found your topic
-   links to sources you explored that were not explored in class or for previous explorations
-   some sort of demo code posted to GitHub
-   a recap of what you learned (documentation/journal)

You will submit your sources, links to code, the actual code files, the recap, screenshots, etc. on Github Classroom and then download your repo to a zip file named [Pawprint]Exploration4.zip and submit it on canvas to be graded **Make sure Github and Canvas are both up-to-date and have the same submission. (120 points)**.

## Getting Started and GitHub Submission Link

To start the challenge, go to this link:  [https://classroom.github.com/a/PqAbraqR](https://classroom.github.com/a/PqAbraqR)

Link your account, clone the repository, make a new branch, go into the code directory, and create your application 

Make sure you start a new development branch. The master branch will be the production branch. Implement and do several commits. Every time you save, do a commit. Every now and then, merge the code from the development to the master (Every time you get to a good stopping point, for this challenge you can merge after each requirement you complete). At the end, when you are finished, do the final commit to development, and the final merge to master.

At the end, before the deadline, make sure you push the master back to the origin for grading. You can also push up your development branch so we can see all your commits. 

**If you work the entire time on master, you will get points deducted.**  This is not a good industry practice.

After pushing back to origin for the final submission, I recommend to go to your GitHub repository on GitHub, download the repository which will give you a zip file of your repo on your local machine, then submit that zip to canvas as a backup. The submission will require both on GitHub and Canvas.

**Note:** If you do not submit on GitHub Classroom then points will be deducted. In addition, if you do not submit to Canvas, then points will be deducted. 

**Note:** If you work on the master branch the entire time, points will be deducted. Create a development branch and work from there. 

## Deliverables 
The deliverables are the same as Exploration 1:

### 1. Sources

Where did you learn and what helped you figure it out? Provide title and a link to the topic you are investigating and any resources that help you along the way.

### 2. Code

What did you make? Provide samples of code, showing what you learned. These samples can be demos. They donâ€™t need to be polished; they just need to demonstrate what you experimented with.

### 3. Recap 

How did it go? Write about the topic you explored and what you experienced. This is your documentation. The documentation is a journal-style document that details the stuff you have explored.  You can think of it as a journal that reflects what you learned, the problems you faced, and how you solved them. If you go back and run through the material again or think about the TA reading this journal, it should help to guide them through your findings. Almost like your own personal tutorial with explanations. *If you are unclear what you need to do for this, then please let me or TAs know.*

### 4. Screenshots 

Take screenshots of your application running for proof. In addition, I recommend you take some screenshots of your code after you are finished with it. All screenshots must have the system clock. The system clock must have the date and time in order to be valid. 


## Tasks

1.  Create a post on the  _Exploration 4_  discussion board with your sources, links to running code, and recap  **(30 points)**.
    -   I want students to use this for ideas, motivation, and to get involved with the class. 
    - **However, if two explorations are thought to be copied off each other or cheating is suspected, then no points will be rewarded.**
    -   What exactly should be on the discussion board?
        1. a link to the job posting where you found your topic
        2. links to sources you explored that were not explored in class or for previous explorations
        3. a recap of what you learned (documentation/journal)
	       - The journal should help someone to guide them through your findings and show off how much you explored. Almost like your own personal tutorial
	        - Trouble shooting tidbits
        4.  Links to your running code on your instance
            -   Show off your work !!
        5. Do **not** post your code on the discussion board
2.  Push your sources, links to code, the actual code files, the recap, and everything else associated with this exploration to the GitHub classroom remote repository listed above. 
	- Make sure you do not include unnecessary files like `node_modules`. 
	- After the repository is uploaded to the remote, I recommend you download your remote repository as a zip file from GitHub, and submit the GitHub zip file to Canvas that way you don't include unnecessary files like `node_modules` on the Canvas submission as well. 
	- Make sure you also submit the link to your server on Canvas as well. Use the `Website URL` tab in order to upload a URL for the submission. 
	- When you submit the zip file on canvas you will name it `<Pawprint>Exploration4.zip` and submit it on canvas as backup. 
	    -   If your pawprint is abc123 then the zip file will be named `Abc123Exploration4.zip`
    -   What exactly should be in the Github submission and zip file on Canvas? **(120 points)**
        1.  A folder for all your code, labeled "code"  **(40 points)**  
            -   This will contain the html, css, javascript, configuration files, php, and any other code you wrote for the exploration. The more the better.
        2.  A document that contains links to the documentation and components you explored, trouble shooting tidbits, your GitHub Repository Link, and a link to your running code on your instance (there needs to be some example of your exploration running on the AWS server). The document should be named "Sources" with the corresponding file extension .md  **(20 points)**
            -   For example: `<Pawpring>Sources.md` so if your pawpring is abc123 then the file would be named `Abc123Sources.md`
            - Do not submit a text file or a word document 
        3.  Your journal that reflects what you learned, problems you faced, and how you solved them. Please link your screenshots in the journal just like you did for the previous challenge. The journal will be named "journal" with the corresponding file extension .md **(40 points)**
            -   For example: `<Pawpring>Journal.md` so if your pawprint is abc123 then the file would be named `Abc123Journal.md`
            - Link your screenshots in the journal just like you did in the previous challenge 
            -   Your journal should be clear, easy to read, and be of some help. If the TA is reading it, the journal should  guide them through your findings and it should show off how much you explored.
            - Do not submit a text file or a word document 
        4.  A folder for all your screenshots. The folder will be named "screenshots" which will contain screenshots of code running on the instance with the system clock in the screenshots.  **(20 points)**
            - Link the screenshots in the journal for easy access 
            - The system clock must include the date and time to be valid 
            - You should have a few screenshots with your instances URL in them   
            - For example, you might take a screenshot for each of the pages you implemented running on your instance with the system clock in them 
            - You may even take some screenshots of the completed code
            - The more the better
